    <b>Problem</b>
<p>The [redacted] server installation kit, version 11.0.7 and later, on AIX does not include the product samples.</p>

<b>Cause</b>
<p>AIX has a 2GB binary limit on program installers. To keep the [redacted] installer size within the specified limit, the samples files are not included with the installer.</p>

<b>Environment</b>
<p>AIX</p>

<b>Diagnosing The Problem</b>
<p>When installing [redacted], the component selection panel in the installation wizard does not include the Samples check box.

After [redacted] is installed, the <b><ca_install_location>/samplesdirectory</b> is not available.</p>

<b>Resolving The Problem</b>
<b><p>Option 1</b></p>

If you have [redacted] Server installed on a different platform, such as Windows, Linux or Solaris, transfer the samples files from that installation to the AIX installation using a file transfer tool. For example, using an FTP client, transfer the <ca_install_location>/samples directory and its contents from a Windows server installation to your AIX server installation. By default, [redacted] samples are installed to the <ca_install_location/samples directory.

The samples directory that you transferred to your AIX installation contains the deployment folder with the sample deployments <b>Samples_for_Install</b> and <i><b>[redacted]</b></i>. You need to manually copy these sample deployments to the <b><i><aix_ ca_install_location>\deployment</b></i> directory, and then you can access the sample reports, dashboards, stories, and data in your AIX installation of [redacted]11.0.7.

<b>Option 2</b>


If you do not have [redacted] installed on any other platform, download the samples.zip file from the following location: [redacted link]. Then, transfer the samples files to your AIX server installation.

To access the sample reports, dashboards, stories, and data in your AIX installation of Cognos Analytics, copy the sample deployments <b>Samples_for_Install</b> and <b><i>[redacted]</b></i> to the <b><aix_ ca_install_location>\deployment</b> directory, as described in option 1.
For more information about IBM Cognos Analytics samples, see the Samples Landing Page ([redacted]).
